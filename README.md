- **Comment**: Comment in code will help to clarify the function and part of code, and will help us to later figure out what the code actually does
    
    ```jsx
    // This is an in-line comment
    ```
    
    ```jsx
    /*  this is a 
    multi-line comment */
    ```
    
- **Variable**:  a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to, which could contain or store eight different data types in Javascript, which are:
    
    [JavaScript Data Types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp)
    
    [JavaScript data types and data structures - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)
    
    Primitive: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive)
    
    InÂ [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript), aÂ **primitive**Â (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not anÂ [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object)Â and has noÂ [methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Method). There are 7Â primitive data types:Â [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String),Â [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number),Â [bigint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BigInt),Â [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean),Â [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/undefined),Â [symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Symbol), andÂ [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null).
    
    How & Rules:
    
    - JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right.
    - 
    
    What:
    
    `undefined`
    
    variable without a value has `undefined` as a value, and can be assigned to undefined as `undefined` types. but if the variable assigned to be empty value with strings, so the value gonna be empty with type data as strings.
    
    ```jsx
    var me; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    var me = undefined // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    var me = ""; // the value is "", the typeof is "string"
    ```
    
    `null`
    
    null type has only one value: `null` , as invalid object or represents absence of any object value. but compared to undefined, null only has the equality with undefined but not as identity.
    
    null also mean pointing to not pointing to any object, and expected that no object is relevant to those.
    
    ```jsx
    null === undefined   // false
    null  == undefined   // true
    ```
    
    `boolean`,
    
    have two value, `true` or `false`Â , booleans often used on conditional testing.
    
    ```jsx
    var x = 7;
    var y = 7;
    var x = 10;
    
    (x == y) // return true
    (x == z) // return false
    ```
    
    `string`,Â 
    
    String written with quotes, we can use single or double quotes, and we can use quotes inside a string, as long they doesnâ€™t match with the surrounding quotes.
    
    ```jsx
    var myName1 = "Apis" // using double quotes
    var myName2 = 'Apis' // using single quotes
    var wordA = "It's okay" // single inside double
    var wordB = "Absolutely, called me 'Apis'" //single inside double
    var wordC = 'Absolutely, called me "Apis"' // double insude single
    ```
    
    `symbol`
    
    A Symbol is aÂ **unique**Â andÂ **immutable**Â primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property. more about symbols check here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Symbol)
    
     *ps: I still donâ€™t know when to use this* ðŸ˜„
    
    `bigint`Â 
    
    BigInt is a numeric primitive, can represent integers, we can use the operatorsÂ `+ * - **`andÂ `%`Â with BigIntsâ€”just like with Numbers. A BigInt is not strictly equal to a Number,
    
    *ps: I still donâ€™t know when to use this* ðŸ˜„
    
    `number` 
    
    number can write with pr without a decimals, and large numbers can be write with scientific notation
    
    ```jsx
    var x1 = 30.9 // with decimals
    var x2 = 77 // without decimals
    var x3 = 123e5 // 12300000
    var x4 = 123e-5 // 0.00123
    ```
    
    `object`
    
    written with curly braces `{}`, separated by commas, its has direct value pairs, object as well called the collection of properties.
    
    ```jsx
    const me = {nickName:'Apis', age:28, favColor:"black"};
    ```
    
    `arrays`
    
    written with square brackets, separated by commas, array index starting from zero, which first item gonna be [0], and the next is [1], and so on.
    
    ```jsx
    const pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish'];
    ```
    
    to declare a variable, use `var` then `theName` of variable, and ends with semicolon 
    
    ```jsx
    var myName;
    ```
    

- camelCase
    
    Write variable names in JavaScript inÂ *camelCase*. InÂ *camelCase*, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
    
    ```jsx
    var someVariable;
    var anotherVariableName;
    var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
    ```
    
    It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity
    
- var, let & const
    
    One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with theÂ `var`keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations
    
    In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem. But as your codebase becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching for and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.
    
    So unlikeÂ `var`, when you useÂ `let`, a variable with the same name can only be declared once. 
    
    const comes in different way, as new feature in ES6, that variables declared usingÂ `const`Â are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned withÂ `const`, it cannot be reassigned:
    
    ```jsx
    var me = 'Apis';
    var me = 'Nakula';
    console.log(me); // Nakula
    
    //unlike var, using let can return error, 
    // because the similar variable with same name can only declare once
    let me = 'Apis';
    let me = 'Nakula';
    console.log(me); // error
    
    // const means constant, and shared similar feature that let has,
    // but const only has one-time assigned
    const whatIsmyName = 'Apis';
    whatIsmyName = 'Nakula';
    console.log(whatIsmyName); // error
    ```

Day 2 of #100DaysOfCode 

- JS Math operators
    
    Subtract ( `-` ); multiply ( `*` ); divide ( `/` );  increment ( `++  â†’ i++`); decrement ( `-- â†’ i--`); decimal (decimal numbers often referred as *floating point* numbers, in JS also works for multiplying or divides decimals); remainder ( `%` ) â†’ gives the remainder of the division of two numbers: according to MDN â†’ The remainder operator (`%`) returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand. It always takes the sign of the dividend.
    
    ```jsx
    // Example of reminder
    const remainder = 11 % 3; // return 2, 
    // because Math.floor( 11 / 3) = 3 (Quotient)
    // 3 * 3 = 9 
    // 11 - 9 = 2 (Remainder)
    
    // Remainder (%) operator most often used in?
    ```
    
    - to compound assignment, we can use augmented audition using `+=` operator, for instance:
        
        ```jsx
        let myApis = 1;
        myApis += 5;
        console.log(myApis); // 6
        ```
        
    - compound assignment works as well for subtraction, multiplication, & division , by following :
        
        ```jsx
        // subtraction
        let myApis = myApis - 7;
        //can be written as follow
        myApis -= 7;
        
        // multiplication
        let myApis = myApis * 7;
        //can be written as follow
        myApis *= 7;
        
        // division
        let myApis = myApis / 7;
        //can be written as follow
        myApis /= 7;
        ```
        
    
- Strings in JavaScript:
    - When youâ€™d like to write quotes inside a string, we can use backslash (\) in front:
        
        ```jsx
        const sampleWords= "Apis said, \"Nakula currently sleeping\".";
        // return -> Apis said, "Nakula currently sleeping".
        ```
        

- Quoting strings also works on singles quotes:
    
    ```jsx
    const goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
    const badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"';
    
    // by adding backslash before ( ' ) will make it not reads as end of the strings
    ```
    
- How to escape sequence in strings?
    
    [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/escape-sequences-in-strings)
    

- Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
    
    we can combine two strings in a row by using plus operator in JS, but this plus (+) operator between the two strings will not act as space, so we gotta adding manually on each strings respectively
    
    ```jsx
    const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second."; // I come first. I come second.
    ```
    

- when we dealing with long strings that could be turn into several lines, so very helpful using Plus Equal Operators `+=`
    
    ```jsx
    let ourStr = "I come first. ";
    ourStr += "I come second.";
    
    // I come first. I come second.
    ```
    
- When weâ€™d like using reference variable that has certain value (constant or changing), we can insert one or more variables into a string using `+` operator
    
    ```jsx
    const myName = "Apis";
    const greeting = "Hello, my name is " + myName + ", and you?";
    // Hello, my name is Apis, and you?
    ```
    
- `+=` operator also can be used when weâ€™d like to appending variables into strings,
    
    ```jsx
    const anAdjective = "awesome!";
    let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
    ourStr += anAdjective;
    
    // ourStr would have the value -> freeCodeCamp is awesome!.
    ```
    
- Somehow weâ€™d like to identify the length of a String in some cases, to find out, using `.length` after the variable name would return us how much characterâ€™s length for those variable:
    
    ```jsx
    let lastNameLength = 0;
    const lastName = "Lovelace";
    lastNameLength = lastName.length;
    
    console.log(lastNameLength); // 8
    ```
    
- To get specific character in a string, we can find the index by using Bracket Notation `[]` , because Javascript was Zero-based indexing, so all the index will start with`[0]`
    
    ```jsx
    const firstName = "Apis";
    const firstLetter = firstName[0];
    
    console.log(firstLetter); // A
    ```
    

- String in JavaScript is immutable, its means that they cannot be altered once created, the only way to change by assign new strings, but cannot just one character for the value of those variable.


Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode 20:00-22:00

- In order to target specific sequence character in a string, we could mentioned index sequence in a bracket `myStr[2]`, and as well to identify last character in a string, we could use `.length -1` , and also works if weâ€™d like to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
    
    ```jsx
    const lastName = "Lovelace";
    
    // identify last character in a string
    const lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-1];
    console.log(lastLetterOfLastName); // e
    
    // Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String
    const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
    console.log(secondToLastLetterOfLastName); // c
    ```
    

- JS Array `[]` also can store values, the value might vary based on our needs, we declare the value inside bracket with comma to separate each value. And nested arrays also works inside an array, incase weâ€™d like to grouping several values
    
    ```jsx
    const myArray = ["Fish", 7];
    console.log(myArray); // [Fish, 7]
    
    // nested array
    const myArray = [["Fish", 7], ["Fish2", 8]];
    console.log(myArray); // ["Fish", 7], ["Fish2", 8]
    ```
    
- To access Array data, we can use indexes, as similar to strings, array index use zero-based indexing method.
    
    Arrays value are mutable, so it highly possible to changes and assign to new value, unlike strings.
    
    With multidimensional arrays, accessing index also has similar approach but with following next pointed index as referring next level entries inside.
    
    ```jsx
    const myArray = [50, 60, 70];
    const myData = myArray[0];
    console.log(myData); // 50
    
    // Modify array value
    const myArray = [18, 64, 99];
    myArray[0] = 45;
    console.log(myArray); //[45, 64, 99]
    
    // multi-dimensional array
    const myArray = [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9],
      [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14],
    ];
    const myData = myArray[2][1];
    console.log(myData); // 8
    ```
    
- Manipulating arrays
    
    `.push()` often use to append data to the end of an array, means `.push()` function will add new value inside the arrays.
    
    if weâ€™d like to dismiss end of arrayâ€™s value, using `.pop()` function will removes the last element from an array and return those elements
    
    `.shift()` function was the opposite of `.pop()` function, it would removes our first element in arrays
    
    When it comes to adding new value in the first element of an array, `.unshift()` function will add them as the opposite `.push()`
    
    ```jsx
    // .push()
    const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
    myArray.push(["dog", 3]);
    console.log(myArray); //[ [ 'John', 23 ], [ 'cat', 2 ], [ 'dog', 3 ] ]
    
    // .pop()
    const myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
    const removedFromMyArray = myArray.pop();
    console.log(removedFromMyArray); //[ 'cat', 2 ]
    console.log(myArray); //[ [ 'John', 23 ] ]
    
    // .shift()
    const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
    const removedFromMyArray = myArray.shift();
    console.log(myArray); // [ 'dog', 3 ]
    
    // .unshift()
    const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
    myArray.shift();
    myArray.unshift(["Paul", 35]);
    console.log(myArray); // [ [ 'Paul', 35 ], [ 'dog', 3 ] ]
    ```
    
- Functions in JavaScript are reusable, and it will be print the result every time those functions being called in dev console.
    
    Every functions use parameters to passing a values, parameters are variable that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called
    
    ```jsx
    function reusableFunction() {
      console.log("Hi World");
    }
    reusableFunction(); // Hi World
    
    // passing values with arguments
    function functionWithArgs(a,b) {
      console.log(a+b);
    }
    functionWithArgs(7,9); //16
    functionWithArgs(1,2); //3
    ```
    
    we also can return value from a function with `return`
    
    ```jsx
    function timesFive(n) {
      return n * 5;
    }
    const answer = timesFive(5);
    console.log(answer); //25
    ```
    
    
    Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode #FCC

- Global Scope & Function
    
    Scope in JS means visibility or access ranges that variables had once it declared. If we didnâ€™t use `let` or `const` at the outside of function, then the variables became global scope: which has override consequence if we use similar variables in other place.
    
    ```jsx
    const myGlobal = 10;
    function fun1() {
      // Assign 5 to oopsGlobal Here
       oopsGlobal = 5;
    }
    function fun2() {
      var output = "";
      if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
        output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
      }
      if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
        output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
      }
      console.log(output); // myGlobal: 10 oopsGlobal: 5
    }
    
    ```
    
- Local Scope & Function
    
    Local scope means any variables that declare within a function, and this variable cannot be access from outside of those function
    
    ```jsx
    function myLocalScope() {
      // Only change code below this line
      const myVar = "Apis";
    
      console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar); // inside myLocalScope Apis
    }
    myLocalScope(); // ReferenceError: Can't find variable: myVar
    ```
    
    If the similar variable name was declared in local and global scope, it still works well & highly possible, and they will return the assigned value each of them.
    
    ```jsx
    const outerWear = "T-Shirt";
    
    function myOutfit() {
      const outerWear = "sweater";
      return outerWear;
    }
    
    myOutfit(); // sweater
    ```
    
- Function returning undefined value
    
    Normally function will proceed inner code that assigned to them, but it would returning `undefined` of there is no `return` statement inside the function
    
- Queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order, for any new item will be add at the back of the order, and old item will taken off from the front queue
    
    ```jsx
    
    ```
    
    ##Day 5 of #100DaysOfCode #FCC

- Boolean Values
    
    Boolean has two values, it was `true` and `false`, without a string when to write them in JS
    
- If Statement
    
    If will be used to create a decision when the function return `true` then logic inside curly braces will be executed, and it will not runs when hit `false`
    
    ```jsx
    function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
    if(wasThatTrue) {
      return "Yes, that was true";
    } return "No, that was false";
    }
    ```
    
- Comparison Operators
    
    When weâ€™d like to compare the equality between two values, we could use `==` which wud return boolean ( true or false). 
    
    ```jsx
    function testEqual(val) {
      if (val == 12) {  
        return "Equal";
      }
      return "Not Equal";
    }
    testEqual(10); // Not Equal
    ```
    
    Unlike the equality operator, Strict Equality ( `===` ) will not perform any type of similarity conversion, the comparing value should be has share similar type or value.
    
    ```jsx
    function testStrict(val) {
      if (val === 7) {
        return "Equal";
      }
      return "Not Equal";
    }
    testStrict(10); // Not Equal
    ```
    
    Inequality Operator ( `â‰ ` â†’ `!`(no space)`=` ) is the opposite of `==` , which wud be return `false`, 
    
    ```jsx
    function testNotEqual(val) {
      if ( val != 99) { 
        return "Not Equal";
      }
      return "Equal";
    }
    testNotEqual(10);
    ```
    
    And Strict Equality also has the opposite comparison operator, that was Strict Inequality (`! ==`), which means strict not equal and return `false`, 
    
    ```jsx
    function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
      if (val !== 17) {  
        return "Not Equal";
      }
      return "Equal";
    }
    testStrictNotEqual(10);
    ```
    
    Greater Than Operator (`>`) also works like equality operator, it will be convert data types of value when comparing, and will return `true` when number on left side is greater than right side
    
    ```jsx
    function testGreaterThan(val) {
      if (val > 100 ) {  
        return "Over 100";
      }
      if (val > 10) {  
        return "Over 10";
      }
      return "10 or Under";
    }
    testGreaterThan(10);
    ```
    
    `â‰¥`  (Greater Than Or Equal To) was used to compares two numbers, and it works like the `>` operator, but including the left number as baseline comparison
    
    ```jsx
    function testGreaterOrEqual(val) {
      if (val >= 20 ) {   
        return "20 or Over";
      }
      if (val >= 10 ) {   
        return "10 or Over";
      }
      return "Less than 10";
    }
    testGreaterOrEqual(10);
    ```
    
    Less Than Operator (`<`), works the opposite way of Greater Than Operator.
    
    ```jsx
    function testLessThan(val) {
      if (val < 25) { 
        return "Under 25";
      }
      if (val < 55 ) {   
        return "Under 55";
      }
      return "55 or Over";
    }
    testLessThan(10);
    ```
    
    Less Than or Equal To Operator ( `â‰¤`), works the opposite way of `â‰¥`
    
    ```jsx
    function testLessOrEqual(val) {
      if (val <= 12 ) {  
        return "Smaller Than or Equal to 12";
      }
      if (val <= 24 ) {  
        return "Smaller Than or Equal to 24";
      }
      return "More Than 24";
    }
    testLessOrEqual(10);
    ```
    
    Comparison with Logical And Operator (`&&`), will return `true` if the *operands* to the left and right of it are true
    
    ```jsx
    function testLogicalAnd(val) {
      if (val <= 50 && val >= 25) {
          return "Yes";
      }
      return "No";
    }
    testLogicalAnd(10);
    ```
    
    Logical Or Operator (`||`), will return `true` if the *operands* to the left and right of it are true, otherwise `false`
    
    ```jsx
    function testLogicalOr(val) {
      if (val < 10 || val > 20) {
        return "Outside";
      } 
      return "Inside";
    }
    testLogicalOr(15); // Inside
    ```
    

- Else & Switch Statements
    
    Following block of code will execute when the if statement is true, but if not, the alternate one (after the first code statement) will execute.
    
    ```jsx
    function testElse(val) {
      let result = "";
      if (val > 5) {
        result = "Bigger than 5";
      } else {
        result = "5 or Smaller";
        }
      return result;
      
    }
    testElse(4);
    ```
    
    multiple condition if statements also known as `else if` statements
    
    ```jsx
    function testElseIf(val) {
      if (val > 10) {
        return "Greater than 10";
      } else if (val < 5) {
        return "Smaller than 5";
      } else {
      return "Between 5 and 10";
      }
    }
    testElseIf(7);
    ```
    
    both `if` and `else if` statement will apply sequence order from top to bottom, so we had to carefully craft them
    
    ```jsx
    function orderMyLogic(val) {
      if (val < 5) {
        return "Less than 5";
      } else if 
        (val < 10) {
        return "Less than 10";
      } else {
        return "Greater than or equal to 10";
      }
    }
    
    orderMyLogic(7);
    ```
    
    `switch` statements : AÂ `switch`Â statement tests a value and can have manyÂ *case*Â statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matchedÂ `case`Â value until aÂ `break`Â is encountered.
    
    ```jsx
    function caseInSwitch(val) {
      let answer = "";
        switch(val) {
        case 1:
          answer = "alpha";
          break;
        case 2:
          answer = "beta";
          break;
        case 3:
          answer = "gamma";
          break;
        case 4:
          answer = "delta";
          break;}
      return answer;
    }
    
    caseInSwitch(1);
    ```
    
    We also can set default switch statement as final statement if none of case would match
    
    ```jsx
    function switchOfStuff(val) {
      let answer = "";
     switch(val) {
       case "a":
        answer = "apple";
        break;
      case "b":
        answer = "bird";
        break;
      case "c":
        answer = "cat";
        break;
      default:
        answer = "stuff";
        break
     }
      return answer;
    }
    
    switchOfStuff(1);
    ```
    
    switch statement with multiple inputs with the same output also can perform in group like this one
    
    ```jsx
    function sequentialSizes(val) {
      let answer = "";
      switch(val) {
        case 1:
        case 2:
        case 3:
          answer = "Low";
          break;
        case 4:
        case 5:
        case 6:
          answer = "Mid";
          break;
        case 7:
        case 8:
        case 9:
          answer = "High";
          break;
      }
      return answer;
    }
    
    sequentialSizes(1);
    
    //---------
    // If you have many options to choose from, 
    // a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained 
    // if/else if statements. The following:
    
    function chainToSwitch(val) {
      let answer = "";
      // Only change code below this line
    if (val === 1) {
      answer = "a";
    
    // into
    switch(val) {
      case 1:
        answer = "a";
        break;
    
    // ------------
    
    // sample
    switch(val){
      case "bob":
        answer = "Marley";
        break;
      case 42:
        answer = "The Answer";
        break;
      case 1:
        answer = "There is no #1";
        break;
      case 99:
        answer = "Missed me by this much!";
        break;
      case 7:
        answer = "Ate Nine";
        break;
    }
      return answer;
    }
    
    ```

- `RegEx`  is AN object is used for matching text with a pattern.
    
    [RegExp - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)
    
    ```jsx
    let count = 0;
    
    function cc(card) {
      var regex = /[JQKA]/;
      if (card > 1 && card < 7) {
        count++;
      } else if (card === 10 || regex.test(card)) {
        count--;
      }
      if (count > 0) return count + " Bet";
      return count + " Hold";
    }
    cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');
    ```
    
- JavaScript Object
    
    In most cases Object are similar to an arrays, to access and modify object data, we can use `properties` , Object being used to store data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects.
    
    ```jsx
    const myDog = {
      "name": "puppy",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "friends": ["cats", "lion", "tiger"],
    };
    ```
    
    to access object properties, we can use Dot Notation ( `.` ), and bracket notation `[]`. Dot Notation are used when we know the name of the properties.
    
    ```jsx
    const testObj = {
      "hat": "ballcap",
      "shirt": "jersey",
      "shoes": "cleats"
    };
    const hatValue = testObj.hat;  // ballcap
    const shirtValue = testObj.shirt; // jersey
    
    // using Bracket Notation
    const testObj = {
      "an entree": "hamburger",
      "my side": "veggies",
      "the drink": "water"
    };
    const entreeValue = testObj['an entree'];   
    const drinkValue = testObj['the drink'];   
    
    // another exercise
    const testObj = {
      12: "Namath",
      16: "Montana",
      19: "Unitas"
    };
    const playerNumber =  16 
    const player = testObj[playerNumber]; // Montana
    ```
    
    Object properties also can be updated, we can use either dot or bracket notation to update.
    
    ```jsx
    const myDog = {
      "name": "Coder",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
    };
    myDog.name = "Happy Coder";
    ```
    
    To add new properties to JavaScript Object, as the similar way to modify the properties itself:
    
    ```jsx
    const myDog = {
      "name": "Happy Coder",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
    };
    myDog.bark = "woof";
    console.log(myDog);
    
    /* { name: 'Happy Coder',
      legs: 4,
      tails: 1,
      friends: [ 'freeCodeCamp Campers' ],
      bark: 'woof' } */
    ```
    
    When weâ€™d like to delete properties from JS Object, simply use `delete` properties like this:
    
    ```jsx
    const myDog = {
      "name": "Happy Coder",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
      "bark": "woof"
    };
    delete myDog.tails;
    console.log(myDog);
    ```
    
    Using Objects for Lookups.
    
    ```jsx
    function phoneticLookup(val) {
      let result= "";
      const lookup = {
        "alpha": "Adams",
        "bravo": "Boston",
        "charlie": "Chicago",
        "delta": "Denver",
        "echo": "Easy",
        "foxtrot": "Frank",
      };
      result = lookup[val];
      return result;
    }
    
    phoneticLookup("charlie");
    ```
    
    `.hasOwnProperty(propname)`  is method to determine if that object has the given property name.Â  `.hasOwnProperty()`returnsÂ `true`Â orÂ `false`Â if the property is found or not.
    
    ```jsx
    function checkObj(obj, checkProp) {
      if (obj.hasOwnProperty(checkProp)) {
        return obj[checkProp];
      } else {
        return "Not Found";
      }
    }
    ```
 Day 7 of #100DaysOfCode

- Manipulating complex object
    
    a flexible Data Structure are commonly used in JavaScript, this flexible data can perform combinations of *strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions,* and *objects.*
    
    this approach also called JavaScript Object Notation or JSON: is a related data interchanges format used to store data:
    
    ```jsx
    const myMusic = [ 
    {
      "artist": "Daft Punk",
      "title": "Homework",
      "release_year": 1997,
      "formats": [ 
        "CD",
        "Cassette",
        "LP"
      ],
      "gold": true
    	}
    ]
    ```
    

- Accessing nested objects
    
    To access the sub-properties of an objects, by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.
    
    ```jsx
    const myStorage = {
      "car": {
        "inside": {
          "glove box": "maps",
          "passenger seat": "crumbs"
         },
        "outside": {
          "trunk": "jack"
        }
      }
    };
    
    const gloveBoxContents = myStorage.car.inside["glove box"];
    ```
    
- Accessing nested arrays
    
    To access nested arrays is similar way on accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.
    
    ```jsx
    const myPlants = [
      {
        type: "flowers",
        list: [
          "rose",
          "tulip",
          "dandelion"
        ]
      },
      {
        type: "trees",
        list: [
          "fir",
          "pine",
          "birch"
        ]
      }
    ];
    const secondTree = myPlants[1].list[1]; // pine
    ```
    

- JavaScript While Loops
    
    while loops will runs when a specific condition is true and stops once that conditions is no longer true
    
    ```jsx
    // Setup
    const myArray = [];
    let i = 5;
    while (i >= 0) {
      myArray.push(i);
      i--;
    }
    console.log(myArray); // [5,4,3,2,1,0]
    ```
    
- JavaScript For Loops
    
    for loop has declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:
    
    `for (a; b; c)`, whereÂ `a`Â is the initialization statement,Â `b`Â is the condition statement, andÂ `c`Â is the final expression.
    
    ```jsx
    const myArray = [];
    for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
      myArray.push(i);
    }
    console.log(myArray); //[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
    ```
    
    How if weâ€™d like to iterate Odd Numbers with For Loop: For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing ourÂ `final-expression`, we can count by even numbers.
    
    ```jsx
    const myArray = [];
    for (let i = 1; i < 10; i += 2 ) {
      myArray.push(i);
    }
    console.log(myArray)// [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ]
    ```
    
    Counting backwards also can perform using For Loop, In order to decrement by two each iteration, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final expression.
    
    ```jsx
    const myArray = [];
    for (let i = 9; i > 0; i -= 2) {
      myArray.push(i);
    }
    console.log(myArray); // [ 9, 7, 5, 3, 1 ]
    ```
    
    For Loop also can be used for iterate through an array, by running the loop as long the `i`Â is equal toÂ `length`.
    
    ```jsx
    const myArr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    let total = 0;
    for (let i= 0 ; i < myArr.length; i++  ) {
      total += myArr[i];
    }
    console.log(total); // 20
    ```
    
- JavaScript Do...While Loops
    
    It is called aÂ `do...while`Â loop because it will firstÂ `do`Â one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loopÂ `while`Â the specified condition evaluates toÂ `true`.
    
    what makes theÂ `do...while`Â different from other loops is how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check. Essentially, aÂ `do...while`Â loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once.
    
    ```jsx
    const myArray = [];
    let i = 10;
     do {
      myArray.push(i);
      i++;
    } while (i < 5);
    ```
  
 Day 8 of #100DaysOfCode
- - Replacing Loops with Recursion is the concept can be expressed in terms of itself.
    
    ```jsx
    function sum(arr, n) {
      if(n <= 0) {
        return 0;
      } else {
        return sum(arr, n-1) + arr[n-1];
      }
    }
      console.log(sum([2,3,4], 1)) // 2
    ```
    
    ```jsx
    // exercise profile lookup
    const contacts = [
      {
        firstName: "Akira",
        lastName: "Laine",
        number: "0543236543",
        likes: ["Pizza", "Coding", "Brownie Points"],
      },
      {
        firstName: "Harry",
        lastName: "Potter",
        number: "0994372684",
        likes: ["Hogwarts", "Magic", "Hagrid"],
      },
      {
        firstName: "Sherlock",
        lastName: "Holmes",
        number: "0487345643",
        likes: ["Intriguing Cases", "Violin"],
      },
      {
        firstName: "Kristian",
        lastName: "Vos",
        number: "unknown",
        likes: ["JavaScript", "Gaming", "Foxes"],
      },
    ];
    // answer
    function lookUpProfile(name, prop) {
      for (let i = 0; i < contacts.length; i++) {
        if (contacts[i].firstName === name) {
          if(contacts[i].hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
            return contacts[i][prop]
          } else {
            return "No such property";
          }
        }
      }
      return "No such contact";
    }
    
    lookUpProfile("Akira", "likes");
    
    // explanation
    // The for loop runs, starting the first object in the contacts list
    // If the firstName parameter passed into the function matches the value of the "firstName" key in the first object, the if statement passes.
    // Then, we use .hasOwnPropertiy() to check with a prop as an argment, if it's was trus, the value of prop will returned
    // if statement of finding prop failes, "No such property" is returned
    // if the first if statements fails, for loop continues on the next object of contact list
    // If the firstName parameter isnâ€™t matched by the final contacts object, the for loop exits and No such contact is returned.
    ```
    

- Random Fractions
    
    Random fractions in Javascript using `Math.random()` that generates a random decimal number between 0 and 1.
    
    ```jsx
    function randomFraction() {
      return Math.random();
    }
    console.log(randomFraction(2));// 0.3366139865105834
    ```
    
    we can also using random fraction to whole numbers, with helps multiply the `Math.random()` to certain numbers (eq. 20), then use `Math.floor()` to round down the number into nearest whole number.
    
    ```jsx
    function randomWholeNum() {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
    }
    console.log(randomWholeNum(3));// 8
    ```
    
    To generate random whole numbers within a range, by define minimum numbers with min and a maximum number.
    
    ```jsx
    function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin +1) + myMin);
    }
    ```
    

- Using `parseInt` function
    
    ```jsx
    function convertToInteger(str) {
     const a = parseInt(str);
     return a;
    }
    
    console.log(convertToInteger("56")); // 56
    ```
    
    TheÂ `parseInt()`Â function parses a string and returns an integer, 
    
    ```jsx
    function convertToInteger(str) {
      const a = parseInt(str, 2);
      return a;
    }
    console.log(convertToInteger("10011")); // 19
    ```
    
- **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**
    
    The syntax isÂ `a ? b : c`, whereÂ `a`Â is the condition,Â `b`Â is the code to run when the condition returnsÂ `true`, andÂ `c`Â is the code to run when the condition returnsÂ `false`.
    
    ```jsx
    function checkEqual(a, b) {
      return a == b ? "Equal" : "Not Equal";
    }
    
    console.log(checkEqual(1, 2)); // Not Equal
    ```
    
    ternary operator also works in multiple sequences,  by combine with `if`,Â `else if`, andÂ `else`Â statements to check multiple conditions
    
    ```jsx
    function checkSign(num) {
     return (num > 0) ? "positive" 
     : (num < 0) ? "negative"
     : "zero";
    }
    console.log(checkSign(10)); // positive
    ```
    
    **Use Recursion to Create a Countdown**
    
    ```jsx
    function countdown(n){
      if (n < 1 ) {
        return [];
      } else {
        const array = countdown(n-1);
        array.unshift(n);
        return array;
      }
    }
    console.log(countdown(5));// [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
    ```
    
    **Use Recursion to Create a Range of Numbers**
    
    ```jsx
    function rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum) {
      if ( endNum - startNum === 0) {
      return [startNum];
      } else {
        const arr  = rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum -1 );
        arr.push(endNum);
        return arr;
      }
    }
    
    console.log(rangeOfNumbers( 6,9)); // [ 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
    ```
   
   Day 9 of #100DaysOfCode

- Deep dive on Recursion
    
    [Recursion in Programming - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDJ0kBx2LM)
    
    Recursion is nothing more than a method that calls itself. Condition that stopping the condition based on the Base Case, with looping Recursive Call.
    
    Trade Off: Pros
    
    - Bridges the gap between elegance & complexity
    - Reduce need for complex loops & auxiliary data structures, with implicit stacks, self manage looping contract
    - can reduce time complexity with memoization
    - works really well in trees, graphs, will focus on small tiny set recursive data structures
    
    Trade Off: Cons
    
    - slowness due to CPU overhead
    - Can lead to out memory errors / stack overflow exeptions
    - Can be unnecessary complex if poorly constructed
    
    Call Stack | Cases:
    
    We need to return value as base case to stop the function runs (stop invoking method)
    
    ```jsx
    public String reverseString(String input) {
    // what is the base case? (when can i no longer continue)
    // what is the smallest amount of work I can do in each iteration?
    ```
    
    - String Reversal

ECMAScript -ES6
Day 10 of #100DaysOfCode
ES6 â†’ Standardized version of JavaScript

- **Scopes of var & let**
    
    When variable declared with `var` keyword, then it wud be globally accessible, or locally if declared inside the function.
    
    and using `let` , will enables extra features: when let declared inside a block, statement or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.
    
    ```jsx
    function checkScope() {
      let i = 'function scope';
      if (true) {
        let i = 'block scope';
        console.log('Block scope i is: ', i);
      }
      console.log('Function scope i is: ', i);
      return i;
    }
    
    // Block scope i is:  block scope
    // Function scope i is:  function scope
    ```
    
- **Using `const` in JavaScript**
    
    Using theÂ `const`Â declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier. When const used on arrays and functions are still mutable.
    
- **Prevent Object from mutation**
    
    JavaScript provides a functionÂ `Object.freeze`Â to prevent data mutation.
    
    ```jsx
    function freezeObj() {
      const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
        PI: 3.14
      };
      Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);
      try {
        MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
      } catch(ex) {
        console.log(ex);
      }
      return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
    }
    const PI = freezeObj();
    console.log(PI); // 3.14
    ```
    
- **Arrow Functions**
    
    arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keywordÂ `return`Â as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:
    
    ```jsx
    const myFunc = () => "value";
    // also can be written like this
    const myFunc = function() {
      const myVar = "value";
      return myVar;
    }
    
    // both will return "value"
    ```
    
    Arrow function also used with parameters, just like regular function, itâ€™s could be pass an arguments into arrow function.
    
    ```jsx
    const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => {
      return arr1.concat(arr2);
    }
    console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5])); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
    ```
    
- **Default Parameters**
    
    In ES6, default parameters are given for help us to fill the argument when the argument is not specified, which the return value will shown as default parameter.
    
    ```jsx
    const increment = (number, value = 1) => number + value;
    console.log(increment(5)); // 6
    ```
    
- **Rest Parameters**
    
    With the rest parameter, which can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.
    
    ```jsx
    const sum = (...args) => {
      return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    }
    console.log(sum(0,1,2)); // 3
    ```
    
- **Spread Operator**
    
    Spread Operator has ability to copy an array
    
    ```jsx
    const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
    let arr2;
    arr2 = [...arr1]; 
    console.log(arr2); // [ 'JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY' ]
    ```
    
- **Destructuring Assignment**
    
    ```jsx
    const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
      yesterday: 75,
      today: 77,
      tomorrow: 80
    };
    
    const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
    ```
```jsx
const result = {
  success: ["max-length", "no-amd", "prefer-arrow-functions"],
  failure: ["no-var", "var-on-top", "linebreak"],
  skipped: ["no-extra-semi", "no-dup-keys"]
};
function makeList(arr) {
  // ---------------------
  const failureItems = [];
   for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
     failureItems.push(`<li class="text-warning">${arr[i]}</li>`);
   }
   ;
  // -------------

  return failureItems;
}

const failuresList = makeList(result.failure);

console.log(failuresList);

// answer
[ '<li class="text-warning">no-var</li>',
  '<li class="text-warning">var-on-top</li>',
  '<li class="text-warning">linebreak</li>' ]
```

- Object Property Shorthand
    
    ES6 provides the syntactic sugar to eliminate the redundancy of having to writeÂ `x: x`. You can simply writeÂ `x`Â once, and it will be converted to`x: x`
    
    ```jsx
    //from this
    const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => {
      return {
        name: name,
        age: age,
        gender: gender
      };
    };
    
    // to this
    const createPerson = (name, age, gender) => ({ name, age, gender});
    ```
    
- Concise Declarative Function in ES6
    
    ```jsx
    // ES5 function method
    const person = {
      name: "Taylor",
      sayHello: function() {
        return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
      }
    };
    
    //ES6 way
    const person = {
      name: "Taylor",
      sayHello() { // remove 'function'
        return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
      }
    };
    ```
    
- Class Syntax
    
    `class` keywords are used to create objects in ES6, to utilize this syntax, we need use UpperCamelCase and the `constructor` method (special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class)
    
    ```jsx
    class Vegetable {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }
    }
    const carrot = new Vegetable('carrot');
    console.log(carrot.name); // 'carrot'
    ```
    
- getters & setters
    
    Getter functions are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.
    
    Setter functions are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private variable based on the value passed into the setter function.
    
    ```jsx
    class Thermostat{
      constructor(f) {
        this.f = f;
      }
      // getter
      get temperature() {
        return (5/9)*(this.f -32);
      }
      //setter
      set temperature(c) {
        this.f = (c*9.0)/5 + 32;
      }
    
    }
    const thermos = new Thermostat(76); // Setting in Fahrenheit scale
    let temp = thermos.temperature; // 24.44 in Celsius
    thermos.temperature = 26;
    temp = thermos.temperature; // 26 in Celsius
    ```
    
- Module Script
    
    In order to make JavaScript more modular, clean, and maintainable; ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files. This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them.
    
    ```jsx
    <html>
      <body>
    <script type="module" src="index.js"></script> 
      </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
- Export to share a code block
    
    variables can share from one to multiple Javascript files, by using `export` to the intended variables. When you export a variable or function, you can import it in another file and use it without having to rewrite the code.
    
    ```jsx
    const uppercaseString = (string) => {
      return string.toUpperCase();
    }
    
    const lowercaseString = (string) => {
      return string.toLowerCase()
    }
    
    export { uppercaseString, lowercaseString };
    ```
    
- Reuse JS Code using `import`
    
    `import`Â allows you to choose which parts of a file or module to load. and we can also import one or more item from the file
    
    ```jsx
    import { uppercaseString, lowercaseString } from './string_functions.js';
    
    uppercaseString("hello");
    lowercaseString("WORLD!");
    ```
    
- using `*` to import everything from the file
    
    ```jsx
    import * as stringFunctions from "./string_functions.js";
    
    stringFunctions.uppercaseString("hello");
    stringFunctions.lowercaseString("WORLD!");
    ```
    
- Export Fallback
    
    *export default*. Usually you will use this syntax if only one value is being exported from a file. It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.
    
    you can only have one value be a default export in each module or file. Additionally, you cannot useÂ `export default`Â withÂ `var`,Â `let`, orÂ `const`
    
    ```jsx
    export default function subtract(x, y) {
      return x - y;
    }
    ```
    
- Import a Default Export
    
    To import a default export, you need to use a differentÂ  `import`Â   syntax, like this
    
    ```jsx
    import subtract from "./math_functions.js";
    subtract(7,4);
    ```
    
- JavaScript Promise
    
    `Promise`Â is a constructor function, so you need to use theÂ `new`keyword to create one. It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters -Â `resolve`Â andÂ `reject`. These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise. The syntax looks like this:
    
    ```jsx
    const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    
    });
    ```
    
    A promise has three states:Â `pending`,Â `fulfilled`, andÂ `rejected`. to actually finish the promise, we need build method to take the argument resolve or reject to fulfilled.
    
    ```jsx
    const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      if(condition here) {
        resolve("Promise was fulfilled");
      } else {
        reject("Promise was rejected");
      }
    });
    
    // sample
    const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
      let responseFromServer;
        
      if(responseFromServer) {
        resolve("We got the data");
      } else {  
        reject("Data not received");
      }
    });
    ```
    
    If weâ€™d like to handle `Promise`, This can be achieved by using theÂ `then`Â method. TheÂ `then`Â method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled withÂ `resolve`.
    
    ```jsx
    myPromise.then(result => {
      
    });
    
    // sample
    const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
      let responseFromServer = true;
        
      if(responseFromServer) {
        resolve("We got the data");
      } else {  
        reject("Data not received");
      }
    });
    
    makeServerRequest.then(result => {
      console.log(result);
    })
    ```
    
    if the Promise got rejected, we handle them with `catch`
    
    ```jsx
    myPromise.catch(error => {
      
    });
    // sample
    const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // responseFromServer is set to false to represent an unsuccessful response from a server
      let responseFromServer = false;
        
      if(responseFromServer) {
        resolve("We got the data");
      } else {  
        reject("Data not received");
      }
    });
    
    makeServerRequest.then(result => {
      console.log(result);
    });
    
    makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
      console.log(error);
      });
    ```
**REGULAR EXPRESSION**
Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.

Day 13 of #100DaysOfCode

- `.test()` method
    
    takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returnsÂ `true`Â orÂ `false`Â if your pattern finds something or not.
    
    ```jsx
    let myString = "Hello, World!";
    let myRegex = /Hello/;
    let result = myRegex.test(myString); // true
    ```
    
- Match a Literal String with Different Possibilities
    
    We can search for multiple patterns using the Â `alternation` Â orÂ  `OR`Â  operator:Â `|`.
    
    ```jsx
    let petString = "James has a pet cat.";
    let petRegex = /dog|cat|bird|fish/; 
    let result = petRegex.test(petString);
    ```
    
- Ignore Case while matching
    
    This regex can match the stringsÂ `ignorecase`,Â `igNoreCase`, andÂ `IgnoreCase`.
    
    ```jsx
    let myString = "freeCodeCamp";
    let fccRegex = /freeCodeCamp/i; 
    let result = fccRegex.test(myString);
    ```
    
- Extract Matches `.match()`
    
    Note that theÂ `.match`Â syntax is the "opposite" of  theÂ  `.test` method
    
    ```jsx
    'string'.match(/regex/);
    /regex/.test('string');
    
    //sample
    let extractStr = "Extract the word 'coding' from this string.";
    let codingRegex = /coding/; 
    let result = extractStr.match(codingRegex);
    ```
    
- `g` flag
    
    `g` flag was used to find more that the first match
    
    ```jsx
    let twinkleStar = "Twinkle, twinkle, little star";
    let starRegex = /Twinkle/gi; 
    let result = twinkleStar.match(starRegex); 
    ```
    
- Wildcard period
    
    The wildcard characterÂ `.`Â will match any one character. The wildcard is also calledÂ `dot`Â andÂ `period`. You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to matchÂ `hug`,Â `huh`,Â `hut`, andÂ `hum`, you can use the regexÂ `/hu./`Â to match all four words.
    
    ```jsx
    let exampleStr = "Let's have fun with regular expressions!";
    let unRegex = /un./; 
    let result = unRegex.test(exampleStr);
    ```
    
- Matching single character with multiple possibilities
    
    You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility withÂ *character classes*. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square (`[`Â andÂ `]`) brackets.
    
    ```jsx
    let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
    let vowelRegex = /[aeiou]/gi;
    let result = quoteSample.match(vowelRegex); 
    ```
    
- Match Letters of the Alphabet
    
    Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character:Â `-`.
    
    For example, to match lowercase lettersÂ `a`Â throughÂ `e`Â you would useÂ `[a-e]`.
    
    ```jsx
    let quoteSample = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
    let alphabetRegex = /[a-z]/gi; 
    let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegex);
    ```
    
- Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet
    
    ```jsx
    let quoteSample = "Blueberry 3.141592653s are delicious.";
    let myRegex = /[h-s2-6]/ig; 
    let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); 
    ```

- Find Character for one or more
    
    ```jsx
    let difficultSpelling = "Mississippi";
    let myRegex = /s+/g; // Change this line
    let result = difficultSpelling.match(myRegex);
    ```
    
- Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times
    
    ```jsx
    // Only change code below this line
    let chewieRegex = /Aa*/; // Change this line
    // Only change code above this line
    
    let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);
    ```
    
- Find Characters with Lazy Matching
    
    you can use theÂ `?`Â character to change it to lazy matching.
    
    ```jsx
    let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
    let myRegex = /<.*?>/; // Change this line
    let result = text.match(myRegex);
    ```


- Match Beginning String Patterns
    
    We used the caret character (`^`) inside a character set to create a negated character set in the formÂ `[^thingsThatWillNotBeMatched]`. Outside of a character set, the caret is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.
    
    ```jsx
    let rickyAndCal = "Cal and Ricky both like racing.";
    let calRegex = /^Cal/; 
    let result = calRegex.test(rickyAndCal);
    ```
    
- Match Ending String Patterns
    
    We can search the end of strings using the dollar sign characterÂ `$`Â at the end of the regex.
    
    ```jsx
    let caboose = "The last car on a train is the caboose";
    let lastRegex = /caboose$/;
    let result = lastRegex.test(caboose);
    ```


- match all number: `/\d/g`
- match all non numbers : `/\D/g`
- Using shorthand character class (`\w` )to match all letters and number
- Restrict Possible Username
    
    ```jsx
    //case
    //Usernames can only use alpha-numeric characters.
    //The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.
    //Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.
    //Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.
    
    //solutions
    let username = "JackOfAllTrades";
    let userCheck = /^[a-z]([0-9]{2,}|[a-z]+\d*)$/i; 
    let result = userCheck.test(username);
    ```
    
- Match whitespace
    
    using `\s` to search the white space, This pattern not only matches whitespace, but also carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters.
    
    ```jsx
    let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
    let countWhiteSpace = /\s/g;
    let result = sample.match(countWhiteSpace);
    ```
    

- Match Non-Whitespace Characters
    
    Search for non-whitespace usingÂ `\S`, which is an uppercaseÂ `s`. This pattern will not match whitespace, carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters.
    
    ```jsx
    let sample = "Whitespace is important in separating words";
    let countNonWhiteSpace = /\S/g; 
    let result = sample.match(countNonWhiteSpace);
    ```
    
- Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches
    
    Recall that you use the plus signÂ `+`Â to look for one or more characters and the asteriskÂ ``Â to look for zero or more characters.
    
    You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns withÂ *quantity specifiers*. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets (`{`Â andÂ `}`).
    
    ```jsx
    let ohStr = "Ohhh no";
    let ohRegex = /Oh{3,6}\sno/;
    let result = ohRegex.test(ohStr);
    ```
    
- Specify Only the Lower Number of Matches
    
    To only specify the lower number of patterns, keep the first number followed by a comma
    
    ```jsx
    let haStr = "Hazzzzah";
    let haRegex = /Haz{4,}ah/; // Change this line
    let result = haRegex.test(haStr);
    ```
    
- Specify Exact Number of Matches
    
    To specify a certain number of patterns, just have that one number between the curly brackets.
    
    ```jsx
    let timStr = "Timmmmber";
    let timRegex = /Tim{4}ber/; 
    let result = timRegex.test(timStr);
    ```
    
- Check for All or None
    
    You can specify the possible existence of an element with a question mark,Â `?`. This checks for zero or one of the preceding element. You can think of this symbol as saying the previous element is optional.
    
    ```jsx
    let favWord = "favorite";
    let favRegex = /favou?rite/;
    let result = favRegex.test(favWord);
    ```
    
- Positive and Negative Lookahead
    
    *Lookaheads*Â are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along. This can be useful when you want to search for multiple patterns over the same string.
    
    - A positive lookahead is used asÂ `(?=...)`Â where theÂ `...`Â is the required part that is not matched.
    - A negative lookahead is used asÂ `(?!...)`Â where theÂ `...`Â is the pattern that you do not want to be there.
    
    ```jsx
    let sampleWord = "astronaut";
    let pwRegex = /(?=\w{6,})(?=\w*\d{2})/;
    let result = pwRegex.test(sampleWord);
    ```
    
- Check For Mixed Grouping of Characters
    
    ```jsx
    let myString = "Eleanor Roosevelt";
    let myRegex = /(Eleanor|Franklin).*Roosevelt/;
    let result = myRegex.test(myString); 
    // After passing the challenge experiment with myString and see how the grouping works
    console.log(result); // true, (using .* to allow middle name
    ```
    
- Reuse Patterns Using Capture Groups
    
    ```jsx
    let repeatNum = "42 42 42";
    let reRegex = /^(\d+)\s\1\s\1$/;
    let result = reRegex.test(repeatNum);
    ```
    
- Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace
    
    You can search and replace text in a string usingÂ `.replace()`Â on a string. The inputs forÂ `.replace()`Â is first the regex pattern you want to search for. The second parameter is the string to replace the match or a function to do something.
    
    ```jsx
    let str = "one two three";
    let fixRegex = /(\w+)\s(\w+)\s(\w+)/; 
    let replaceText = "$3 $2 $1"; 
    let result = str.replace(fixRegex, replaceText);
    ```
    
- Remove Whitespace from Start and End
    
    ```jsx
    let hello = "   Hello, World!  ";
    let wsRegex = /^\s+|\s+$/g; 
    let result = hello.replace(wsRegex, ""); 
    console.log(result);
    ```
    
**Debugging**

- **Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable**
    
    TheÂ `console.log()`Â method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool.
    
- **Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console**
    
    There are many methods to use withÂ `console`Â to output messages.Â `log`,Â `warn`, andÂ `clear`Â to name a few. The freeCodeCamp console will only outputÂ `log`Â messages, while the browser console will output all messages.
    
- **Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable**
    
    useÂ `typeof`Â to check the data structure, or type, of a variable.
    
    JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types:Â `Boolean`,Â `Null`,Â `Undefined`,Â `Number`,Â `String`, andÂ `Symbol`Â (new with ES6) and one type for mutable items:Â `Object`.
    
    ```jsx
    let seven = 7;
    let three = "3";
    console.log(seven + three); // 73
    console.log(typeof seven); // number
    console.log(typeof three); // string
    ```
    
- **Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names**
- **Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes**
    
    One way to avoid this mistake is as soon as the opening character is typed, immediately include the closing match, then move the cursor back between them and continue coding.
    
- **Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator**
- **Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes**
- **Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call:** When a function or method doesn't take any arguments, you may forget to include the (empty) opening and closing parentheses when calling it.
    
    ```jsx
    function getNine() {
      let x = 6;
      let y = 3;
      return x + y;
    }
    
    let result = getNine();
    console.log(result);
    ```
    
- **Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function**
    
    ```jsx
    function raiseToPower(b, e) {
      return Math.pow(base, exp);
    }
    
    let base = 2;
    let exp = 3;
    let power = raiseToPower(base, exp);
    console.log(power);
    ```
    
- **Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing**
    
    *Off by one errors*Â (sometimes called OBOE) crop up when you're trying to target a specific index of a string or array (to slice or access a segment), or when looping over the indices of them. JavaScript indexing starts at zero, not one, which means the last index is always one less than the length of the item.
    
    ```jsx
    function countToFive() {
      let firstFive = "12345";
      let len = firstFive.length;
      // Only change code below this line
      for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      // Only change code above this line
        console.log(firstFive[i]);
      }
    }
    
    countToFive(); // 1 2 3 4 5 
    ```

- **Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition**

**Basic Data Structures**
- **Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data**
    
    aÂ *one-dimensional array*, meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Notice it containsÂ *booleans*,Â *strings*, andÂ *numbers*, among other valid JavaScript data types.
    
    aÂ *multi-dimensional array*, or an array that contains other arrays. Notice that this array also contains JavaScriptÂ *objects*
    
    ```jsx
    let yourArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation
    ```
    
- **Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation**
    
    In an array, each array item has anÂ *index*. This index doubles as the position of that item in the array. JavaScript arrays areÂ *zero-indexed*, meaning that the first element of an array is actually at theÂ ***zeroth***Â position, not the first.
    
    ```jsx
    let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
    myArray[1] = "x"
    console.log(myArray); // ["a", "x", "c", "d"]
    ```
    
- **Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()**
    
    Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; theÂ `push()`method adds elements to the end of an array, andÂ `unshift()`Â adds elements to the beginning.
